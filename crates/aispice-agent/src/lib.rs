//! aispice-agent: the language model side of aispice.

//! Providers (Anthropic, and anything OpenAI-compatible) stream into one set
//! of canonical message types, a registry of typed tools serves both the
//! agent loop and the MCP server, and configuration and API keys live in
//! their own modules. The loop and the tool abstraction are generic: they
//! know nothing about schematics or simulators, and the concrete tools reach
//! their project through [`tool::ToolContext::state`].
