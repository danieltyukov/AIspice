# Contributing to aispice

Thanks for helping. Bug reports, circuits that aispice gets wrong, new tools, simulator fixes and documentation are all welcome.

## Before you start

- For a bug, open an issue with the output of `aispice doctor` and, if you can, the smallest `.asc` file that shows the problem.
- For a new feature or a larger change, open an issue first so we can agree on the approach before you spend time on it.
- For a security problem, do not open an issue. Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Setting up

You need Rust 1.88 or newer, Node 22, and ngspice. [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) has the details, including the WebKitGTK packages the desktop app needs on Linux.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/danieltyukov/aispice
cd aispice
npm ci
cargo build -p aispice
```

[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) explains how the crates fit together.

## Checks

```sh
npm run check
```

runs what CI runs for the engine and the interface: `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -D warnings`, `cargo test`, then the interface typecheck, lint and unit tests, and the site build. For the desktop shell, also run `cargo clippy -p aispice-app --all-targets -- -D warnings`.

Other test suites:

| Command | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `npx playwright test` (in `app/`) | The interface in a browser against the mock backend, plus screenshots |
| `npm run test:desktop -w app` | The built desktop app over WebDriver. Build first with `npx tauri build --debug --no-bundle` in `app/`, and run under `xvfb-run -a` on a machine without a display |
| `AISPICE_LTSPICE_TESTS=1 cargo test -p aispice-sim` | Netlists compared live against LTspice, when it is installed |

## Writing changes

- **Tests.** New behaviour needs a test that runs offline. Tests that need a simulator other than ngspice must skip cleanly when it is missing; look at the existing tests in `crates/aispice-sim/tests/` for the pattern.
- **Netlister changes.** Compare against LTspice's own output. Add a schematic and its LTspice netlist to `crates/aispice-sim/tests/schematics/` when you fix a case.
- **Tools.** A tool returns text the model reads and, where the interface shows something, structured data. Keep the description short and concrete. After changing tools, regenerate the reference with `cargo run -p aispice -- docs tools > docs/TOOLS.md`.
- **Security.** Paths go through `Project::resolve`. Processes are started with argument vectors, never a shell string. Anything that writes a file goes through `Workspace::approve`. Treat circuit files, logs and model output as untrusted.
- **Style.** Follow the code around you. `cargo fmt` and the ESLint config settle formatting. Comments explain why, not what.
- **Commits.** Small, focused commits with messages in the conventional style (`fix(core): ...`, `feat(tools): ...`). Update `CHANGELOG.md` under "Unreleased" when behaviour changes.

## What not to commit

- API keys or tokens of any kind.
- Vendor model libraries, process design kits, or anything under a non-disclosure agreement. Simulator tests use generic models only.
- Generated files: `target/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `app/src-tauri/gen/`, `.aispice/` folders.

## Pull requests

Open the pull request against `master` and fill in the template. CI must pass before review. A maintainer merges with a squash or rebase, since the history is kept linear.
